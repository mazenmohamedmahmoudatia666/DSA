/*

Let's change the return request:
 Given array, find the longest sequence that is mountain. Let's say MM
 Then what the problem needs is length(array) - MM
 In other words, let's focus on the complement of the problem.
 We may call that: backward thinking


How to find the longest mountain?
We may write a single DP that tries to solve that
	we need current index, last index, is going up?

A simple observation is: a mountain is actually 2 sub-sequences
The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) ending at X,
	followed by the longest decreasing subsequence  (LDS) starting from X

	Example: Input: 2,1,1,5,6,2,3,1
		The mountain is: 1,5,6,3,1,0
			which is LIS: 1, 5, 6    (end at 6)
			and      LDS: 6, 3, 1, 0 (start from 6)


Coding:
- Let's use the 2nd style of LIS we did before
	- LIS(index): find LIS starting from this index to the end of array, including arr[index]
		This is great definition. We will flip < to > to make it LDS sequence

	- In the problem, we need LIS ending at index NOT starting
		- We will change the code to simply go from the end of the array NOT begin

- After you compute the LIS and LDS, find the max position of LIS[i] + LDS[i] - 1
	why -1? as there is an index SHARED between the 2 sequences

- Special case? Observe the mountain must be increasing then decreasing
	- If one of the LIS[i] or LDS[i] = 1, then there is no mountain
